#Assignment 1: Data Linkage Lab

##Contribution

I worked with Keith and Enrique on beginning to import the 311 dataset during class. For the rest, I received some help from Santiago and Nonie on specific pieces of code (most of which I noted in my notebook), and otherwise worked alone.

##Description

In this assignment, I wrangled three datasets, looking for measurement errors in the 311 data and removing duplicate identifiers and filling in some missing valuables when other data was substantial enough to do so. I merged the 311 dataset with two others: demographics and internet access, and created ratios of characteristics for districts with highest and lowest numbers of complaints to see how they differ. 

Just a note - a few lines of my code takes quite a while to load, but it eventually does (I tested each line before uploading). 

#Assignment 2: Peer Reviews

Uploaded in my HW8 folder. Did reviews for wbx200 and ttd255.
