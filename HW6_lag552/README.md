##**ASSIGNMENT 1**

*Collaboration:* I worked with Nonie Mathur, Santiago Carillo, Alexey Kalinin, and Maisha Lopez on downloading the data correctly and data wrangling, as well as the basic plots. Later, Santiago showed me his code (that he got help with from Kristi Korgsberg) and through that I completed the log plots and chi-square test, looking over the code carefully and using my own variables as I tried to understand their process.

*Summary:* Here, we took two sets of data, merged them using a common variable (BBL), and plotted the variables of interest against each other to try and find the best fit for our data. Because of the way the data appeared in a raw plot of total energy against number of units, we did a log plot to better visualize the data and fit both linear and 2nd degree polynomial lines to it. We concluded that the polynomial line was a better fit than the linear model. 


##**ASSIGNMENT 2**

*Authorea Link:* https://www.authorea.com/users/106326/articles/133244/_show_article

*Notebook:* In HW6_lag552 repo as "HW6_Assignment 2_lag552"

*Collaboration:* I worked with Nonie Mathur, Santiago Carillo, Alexey Kalinin, and Maisha Lopez. We all discussed the changes to be made to our hypothesis statements and the test to perform and worked through this together. I personally contributed significantly to the write-up and to the z-test interpretation, as well as writing the code for the overlapping histogram figure.

*Summary:* We finished our Citi Bike analysis, testing our hypothesis about whether those 35 and under bike for longer durations that the general user. We ultimately rejected our null hypothesis using a z-test as suggested by our peer reviewers.

your authorea article is set to private and I cannot see it. laura changed the setting after I asked you all to.

the analysis is good, but you did not explit any of the capabilities of authorea: you did not put the plots in the article context, but put them all at the end, you did not write the equations for H0 Ha (or the z test, which is also an easy equation) you did not have the authors listed as authors so the paper does not link you your accounts and is not in your portfolio, etc. look at the comments int he paper itself.
