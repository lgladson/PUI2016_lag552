## Review by gsm317
 - The data being used is not clear to me because I don't believe there are any prisons for violent offenders in New York City. I suspect the inmate population represents detention facilities operated by the NYC Department of Corrections, chiefly on Rikers Island and with smaller facilities in several boroughs. Traditionally, prisons are facilities for long term incarceration after conviction, while jails are temperary holding facilities for shorter sentences, people awaiting trail or court appearances on appeal. It's also not clearly stated if the population is men, women or both and what level of incarceration or security.
 - It might be helpful to represent the number of incidents as per capita against inmate population in thousands. This would make the scale of each axis more similar.
 - It's not clear to me why specifically stabbings/slashings were used rather than the overall violent incidents, which may be less random.

Overall, the plot is very clear in conveying it's point, but a more interesting analysis might be using the New York State inmate population of 55,245 for the larger sample size and breaking the data down by prison facility or even better by cell block to increase data points. Also, further specify the population by security level (maximum), gender (males are much more likely to commit violent crimes), age and/or sentence length. Also, this would allow the use of a single year of data, which would better represent the relationship between violence and inmate population by minimizing unknown variables through time (changing policies, etc.).
