Santiago and Nonie shared their code with me for this homework. I refered to it a bit for Assignment 1, though I did most of that alone, and used their help mainliy for Assignment 2 at several points (particularly the looping and formating the census data). However, I wasn't able to do the clustering portion since I couldn't understand it and didn't want to just use their code when I didn't know what I was doing! (This will very likely be the post-midterm homework I drop, so if I've done well on homework 10 you probably don't even need to grade this one.)
